# Recovery partitions are fun when wiping out disks. If FreeBSD finds the
# recovery partition, but doesn't find a correct partition table, or finds
# a corrupt partition table at the beginning sectors of the disk, it will
# try and use whatever the recovery partition says should be there, which
# could be horribly wrong if the disk was used after the fact.
#
# This script's purpose is to wipe out the sectors where the GPT primary and
# backup partition tables live (and then some), so the OS doesn't mistakenly
# read the old partition tables and/or go off into the weeds.
#
# `oseek` is there to avoid having to wipe the entire disk to get to the
# recovery partition (which can take a long time on large spinning disks).
