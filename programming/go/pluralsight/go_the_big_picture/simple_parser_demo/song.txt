Electric Six: Danger! High Voltage

Fire in the disco (Dick Valentine >)
Fire in the Taco Bell
Fire in the disco
Fire in the gates of hell
Don't you wanna know how we keep startin' fires (Jack White ;))
It's my desire (Valentine)
It's my desire (White)
Don't you wanna know how we keep startin' fires (Valentine)
It's my desire (White)
It's my desire (Valentine)
It's my desire (both)
Danger, danger (Valentine>)
High voltage
When we touch, when we kiss
Danger, danger (White>)
High voltage
When we touch, when we touch
Danger, danger (both>)
High voltage
When we touch and when kiss
Danger, danger
High voltage (Valentine)
When we touch (Valentine)
When we kiss (White)
When we touch (Valentine)
When we kiss (White)
Well, don't you wanna know how we keep startin' fires (White)
It's my desire (both)
It's my desire (both)
Don't you wanna know how we keep startin' fires (Valentine)
It's my desire (both)
It's my desire (both)
Danger, danger (Valentine>)
High voltage
When we touch, a-when we kiss
Danger, danger (White>)
It's high voltage
When we kiss (both>)
When we touch
When we kiss
When we touch
Danger, danger
High voltage
When we touch
A-when we kiss (Valentine)
When we kiss (White)
Danger (Valentine)
Danger (both)
High volt-(Valentine)
Age (both)
When we touch (Valentine)
When we kiss (Valentine)
When we touch (White)
When we kiss (Valentine)
Lover! (Valentine finishes song>)
Fire in the disco!
Fire in the disco!
Fire in the Taco Bell!

Fire in the disco!
Fire in the gates of hell!
The gates of hell...
