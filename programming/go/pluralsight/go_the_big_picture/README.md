## Development Tools

- Gopls (underlying golang toolchain?)
- Goland (IDE)
- VS: Code

## Common Frameworks

All of the following statements are based on claims made by the author.

- [Go kit](https://gokit.io): Comprehensive microservice framework.
- [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com): Fast, lightweight web framework.
- [Gorilla Toolkit](https://gorillatoolkit.org): Collection of useful tools without framework lock-in.

- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra): Framework for building CLI applications.
- [Standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/std): Zero dependency APIs for managing simple CLIs.

(Already knew these... but the author noted that since the following are
written in Go, extending/modifying the frameworks requires hacking away using
Golang)

- [Docker](docker.com): Application container framework.
- [Kubernetes](kubernetes.io): System for building, deploying, and scaling containerized apps.
- [Terraform](terraform.io): Cloud infra management.
